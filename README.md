# Task Control Backend
Technical test project to apply for the job offer for Java developer.

## Clarifications
-I only ran tests on the frontend related portion of the project. I didn't think it was necessary to do it to the delete or edit functionalities since they are not used in the front.

-There is a backup of the database inside the project under the name of technical_test. I used PostrgreSQL.

-The application.properties file has it configured: spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update. In case of any problem with the database backup please set it to create-drop and create a database with the same name.

-The application.properties file is set to my credentials and the port on which my PostgreSQL installation runs. Please adapt it to your configuration.

## Bugs
To my best understanding everything works correctly.
